### NÃ­colas Luchini de Arruda 


## Resume

I'm currently studying at Fatec Jundiai and working at company Fatec Jr as java back-end programmer developer. I like to learn
new subjects as new tools: spring, react, logic and other languages, lambda, structure data, 
relational and non-relational database, big data design paterns as well. These can be showed
in my projects, for example, "fatec-empresa-jr-backend", "dscatalog", "project-sds4", 
"project-sds5", "workshop-spring-boot-mondgodb". 

Also, there are others subject that I learnt: 
unit automated tests on controller, service and repository, which can be showed in "AutomatedTests" 
and because of it, I'm deeping to learn integration tests, integration tests & web.

But, there is one project in my college which does a big impact in society: Marias. In this project,
I work at java developer in the Android Studio and documentation as well. I learn code better in java 
and do diagram class as well. However, the important is I learn that with our codes, we can do the 
best all of society, because "Marias" is a app to help the law about the women's insurance against 
domestic violence. The project's repository is "AppGm".
